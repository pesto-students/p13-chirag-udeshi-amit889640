    <h1>Poem by Rishard</h1>
    <p>I like to think (and
        the sooner the better!)
        of a cybernetic meadow
        where mammals and computers
        live together in mutually
        programming harmony
        like pure water
        touching clear sky.</p>
    
        <!-- Second stanza -->
        <p>I like to think
          (right now, please!)
          of a cybernetic forest
          filled with pines and electronics
          where deer stroll peacefully
          past computers
          as if they were flowers
          with spinning blossoms.!</p>
        <p>Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>
    
        <!-- Third stanza -->
        <p>I like to think
          (it has to be!)
          of a cybernetic ecology
          where we are free of our labors
          and joined back to nature,
          returned to our mammal
          brothers and sisters,
          and all watched over
          by machines of loving grace.
          </p>
